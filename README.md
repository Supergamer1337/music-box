# music-box
The Music Box is an application for GMs running their games on Discord. It works as a dashboard-style panel for music/sfx/audio selection for an accompanying Discord bot.

## Getting Started
The application is split into 2 main parts, the backend and frontend.

### Backend
For inital setup, execute the following commands (from the project root).
```sh
cd backend/
pnpm i
```
Afterwards you can start developing by using the following commands in two different terminals (in the backend directory).
```sh
pnpm compile
pnpm watch
```
